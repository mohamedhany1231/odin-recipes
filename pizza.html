    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt. </li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil,
             then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth,
             and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator
            . (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.)</li>
        <li>To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it,
             then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake..</li>
